        text: "Fruit produces ethylene, which makes other fruit ripen. Handy if you want to eat that still-hard avocado, not so handy if you want your bunch of bananas to last for a week. So try to separate fruit out as much as possible.  And pop a sheet of FreshPaper or an Eco Egg Fresher For Longer Disc into your salad drawer or fruit bowl. It’ll keep your food fresher for far longer. That means less food waste, and less trips to the shop.",

        description: "If you know you’re not going to get through a whole loaf of bread before it goes stale, just freeze half of it.",
        text: "Take a few slices out the night before to defrost, or toast from frozen. Alternatively, try the FreshPaper sheets for bread. Just pop a sheet in your breadbin and it’ll keep your bread fresher for up to four times as long. It works great for everything from muffins and bagels, to your trusty sliced loaf.",

        description: "Paper towels are really handy, especially if you have kids, or are a bit accident prone.",
        text: "But they cause an awful lot of waste. Eco Egg Bamboo Towels are strong and super-absorbent. They can absorb up to 10 times as much liquid as a paper towel! And best of all, they’re washable. Each sheet can be washed and reused around 85 times, and there are 200 sheets in each packet. That’s 1,700 spills worth. And you’ll save a lot of space in your cupboards.",
